# IVT Spaceship

This is a sample application for the [Integration and Verification Techniques](http://www.mit.bme.hu/oktatas/targyak/vimiac04) course at BME MIT.

The application is simplified and deliberately contains bugs.

## Getting started

- The project is implemented in Java 11.
- The project can be built using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
- [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) is used for tests, and [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) for isolating dependencies.

Clone the reprtrtent of method `fireTorpedos`. They are already partially implemented.
- There are currently two tests (`GT4500Test`), but be aware that they are not proper unit tests, as they do not isolate the dependencies of the tested class.

The code can be built, but due to missing features one of the tests fails. The first execercise will be to fix this.
